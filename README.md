## Features

âœ… Supports waiting for Pods, Services, Deployments and Jobs
âœ… Provides additional wait modes for Pods and Jobs
âœ… Can be used as a library or a standalone CLI tool
âœ… Compatible with Kubernetes versions >= 1.24

## Installation

go get -u github.com/devlincashman/kwait/cmd/kwait

## Usage

### CLI

The kwait CLI tool allows you to wait for Kubernetes resources to become ready. Here's an overview of the available flags:

```bash
Usage of kwait:
  -kind string
        Kind of the Kubernetes resource (e.g., pod, service, job, deployment).
  -l string
        Label selector for the Kubernetes resource.
  -n string
        Kubernetes namespace for the resource. (default "default")
  -name string
        Name of the Kubernetes resource.
```

To wait for a resource to become ready, simply run the kwait program and specify the resource type, name, and (optionally) a label selector. For example, to wait for a deployment named my-deployment in the my-namespace namespace to become ready, run:

```bash
kwait -n my-namespace -kind deployment -name my-deployment
```

The program will wait until the deployment is ready (i.e., all of its replicas are available) or until it times out.

## Supported Resource Types

The kwait program supports the following Kubernetes resource types:

* ðŸš€ Pods
* ðŸš€ Services
* ðŸš€ Deployments
* ðŸš€ Jobs

To wait for a resource of a specific type, use the -kind flag followed by the name of the resource type (e.g., pod, service, etc.).

### Library

The `kwait` package can also be used as a library to wait for Kubernetes resources in your own Go programs. To use the package, simply import it and create a `k8s.Resource` object with the appropriate `k8s.ResourceWatcher` and `k8s.ResourceReadyChecker` implementations.

```go
import (
    "github.com/devlincashman/kwait/internal/k8s"
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
)

func main() {
    // Create a Kubernetes client
    clientset, err := k8s.NewClient()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Create a DeploymentResource
    deploymentResource := k8s.NewDeploymentResource(clientset, "my-namespace")

    // Create a Resource object
    resource := k8s.Resource{
        Watcher:      deploymentResource,
        ReadyChecker: deploymentResource,
    }

    // Wait for the deployment to become ready
    err = resource.WaitForReady("my-namespace", "my-deployment", "")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
